# KinectV2-Kalman
Implementation of Linear Kalman Filter on Kinect V2 skeleton tracking data using MATLAB.

## Description
Smooth out the noise in kinectv2 skeleton tracking algorithm using simple linear Kalman Filtering.
Tested on MATLAB R2018a and Microsoft Kinect V2 for windows.

## Instructions

Simply run the kalman_kinectv2.m file to for the kalman filtering of Kinect V2.
The pointcloud.m is simply a way to compute a pointcloud in matlab using the Kinect V2 Sensor.
